## Overview
In this project, I had to convert a static and not responsive webpage to a fully responsive and accesible for screen readers webpage. Also i had to add service workers so the app could work when network connection is down.

## Running the App
You can visit the live Demo here: [Live Page](https://milenaaz.github.io/restaurant-review-app/)

However if you would like to run it locally follow the steps below:

1. Download or clone the repository in your computer:
    ```git clone https://github.com/milenaAz/restaurant-review-app.git ```
2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
